    			Project 2 - Phase1  - Overview
		  Author: Rafael C. B. de Oliveira
========================================================================

Overview:
===========================

This program was made using Visual Studio 2012 Express, C++, and the OpenGL API for the CSE313 - Computer Graphics course.

Requirements to run the project: Visual Studio 2012 Express and the necessary OpenGL files.

The skeleton code was used for this project.
For phase 01, the missing code for CTreePart::CTreePart() has been completed with the code for procedural tree generation, and the depth level for the tree has been properly updated in CScene::build().
This program is able to create random generated trees. In other words, the program will create different trees every time it is run.
